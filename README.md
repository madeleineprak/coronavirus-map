## COVID-19 Cases in the United States

Due to the current coronavirus pandemic and seeing the [John Hopkin's University Dashboard](https://www.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6) of its statistics, I was inspired to create this map viewer. It is specifically focused on the cases in the United States. The data is updated regulary so what you see on the map are the real cases accounted for on the given day.

You can also click on each circle to view the number of confirmed cases, recoveries and deaths in a bar chart.
